Everything Science Olympiad 

The following code is applied in Arduino devices,
which also employ various other sensors and technology
to gather data. This data is then processed with the 
following code, and displayed either in terminal
or LCD display. 

> Force/Weight Sensor (2023) - Designed and built Arduino system which used a Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) to accurately measure weight of an object. A separate program was created for a Strain Gauge Sensor, but due to limited manufacturing ability (pre-purchased load cells were not allowed) and low budget, an accurate system could not be completed by the competition. [Silver Medal]
> PPM/Voltage Sensor (2022) - Designed and built Arduino system which used electrical prongs, a DS18B20 temperature sensor, and a fixed resistor to calculate temperature, conductivity, and PPM of a saline solution. [Gold Medal]
> Temperature Sensor (2020) - Designed and built Arduino system which used a Thermistor (resistor with depending resistance values based on temperature) to determine temperature of surrounding fluid (ex. air, water, etc.). Due to poor insulation from fluids, the sensor was unable to accurately display measurements and resulted in poor performance during the competition. This issue was resolved following the competition and accuracy was significantly improved.
